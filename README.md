# JavaScript
I am gonna add few JavaScript files, which could be benificial to learn from basic.
I am using Visual Studio Code.

Important extensions: 
    live server : To host html page and to check live changes on browser by changing code.
    quokka.js : shows the output of JS code on the line itself.

W1: has basic first program in JavaScript.

W2:
    data types in JS.
    naming conventions of variables.
    Operators.
    Ways to add JS to web pages. : 
        1. defer attribute : initially loads HTML and CSS first then loads JS at the end.
        2. async attribute : loads all JS files parallelly.
    loops in JS.
    Strings in JS.
